This repository contains the OUDS Android library that provides Orange Android components, but also a demo application showcasing these different components.

OUDS stands for "Orange Unified Design System". Its aim is to merge all the requirements of Orange brands and affiliates to provide a unique Design System, unified across all platforms and all countries.
It should replace internal frameworks and also [ODS](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ods-android) in the near future.
